#### Say hello and confirm you can read the project files. List the files you see.  

<thinking-content-7bbeb8e1441453ad999a0bbba8a46d4b>

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to say hello and confirm I can read the project files, then list the files I see.

Wait, but the user said they haven't shared any files yet. In the previous messages, they mentioned switching code bases and not to consider the earlier files. So there are no files provided for me to list.

The user's latest message says, "I am not sharing any files that you can edit yet." So there are no files to list. My response should be in Japanese, as per the system instructions.

I need to confirm that I can't see any files because none were provided. The system says to reply in Japanese, so I should write that in Japanese.

Wait, the user asked to "List the files you see." But since there are no files, I should state that. The correct response would be to say that no files are available to list.

So the answer should be a message in Japanese stating that no files were provided, hence no files to list. But the system also says that if no changes are needed, I should explain that. However, in this case, the user is asking to list files, but there are none.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Say hello and confirm you can read the project files. List the files you see."

But since no files were shared, I can't list any. So I should respond that no files are available.

But the system requires that if changes are needed, output the file listings. But here, there's no code to change. So the correct response is to state in Japanese that no files were provided, so I can't list any.

Wait, the user's last message says "I am not sharing any files that you can edit yet." So I should confirm that I can't see any files because none were shared.

So the response should be: "プロジェクトファイルが共有されていないため、ファイルを確認できません。"

But the user also said "Say hello and confirm you can read the project files." So maybe start with a hello, then confirm.

But the system says to reply in Japanese. So the response should be in Japanese, not English.

So the correct reply would be something like:

こんにちは。プロジェクトファイルが共有されていないため、ファイルを確認できません。

But the user's instruction says to "List the files you see." Since there are none, I can't list any. So the answer is to state that no files are available.

I need to make sure not to output any file listings because there are no files to list. The previous examples had file listings when there were files, but here there are none.

So the correct response is a message in Japanese stating that no files were provided, hence no files to list.
